# Task 1: The odds are even in this war of mine.
#
# The struggle between the odd and even soldiers has never been so fierce! Each battle will see even and odd soldiers
# thrown in together, all of them integers. The odd soldiers in the battlefield will fight using the 1 bits from their
# binary representation, while the even soldiers will fight using their 0 bits. If present in the battle, soldiers with
# the number 0 will be neutral, hence they will not be fighting for either side. But beware - there are also spies and
# saboteurs - each soldier that wears negative sign can have a negative effect on the battleâ€™s result.
#
# You should return:
# - odds win - if the number of "1" from odd soldiers is larger than the number of "0" from even soldiers
# - evens win - if the number of "1" from odd soldiers is smaller than the number of "0" from even soldiers
# - tie - if there is an equal number of "1" and "0" or when the battlefield is completely empty.
#
# Please note that any prefix that might appear in the binary representation, e.g. 0b , should not be counted towards
# the battle. Examples:
#
# Calculation for a battlefield configuration [5, 3, 14]:
# - odds: 5 and 3 => 101 and 11 => four "1"
# - evens: 14 => 1110 => one "0"
# - result: odds win the battle by a score of 4-1
#
# Examples with negative integers:
# battle([21,-3,20]) => "evens win" // 10101-11 vs 10100, 3-2 vs 3
# battle([7,-3,-14,6]) => "odds win" // 111-11 vs -1110+110, 3-2 vs -1+1
# battle([23,-3, 32, -24]) => "tie" // 10111-11 vs 100000-11000, 4-2 vs 5-3

# Task 2: Minimum effort.
#
# You are moving through difficult terrain. Your goal is to move from the top left corner of the map to the bottom
# right, without losing too much energy. Thereâ€™s one more constraint: you can only move to the right and down. Each
# field you will move through will have a number assigned - this is the cost of travelling through that field. Save your
# energy and win the competition!
#
# How to solve this problem:
# Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename, which contains the description of one or more
# terrain. The first line will have the value of n (the size of the square matrix). This will be followed by n rows of
# the matrix (integer costs in these rows will be comma delimited). After the n rows, the pattern repeats. For each
# terrain definition, please create a separate line where you will output the minimum effort required to travel through
# the terrain.
#
# Example input:
# 2
# 4,6
# 2,8
# 3
# 1,2,3
# 4,5,6
# 7,8,9
#
# Example output:
# 14
# 21

# Solution of task 2 has a little modification - an input is not a path to a filename. Moreover, it is not an efficient
# algorithm, but only a brute force solution.
